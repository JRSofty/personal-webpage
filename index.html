					<h3>The story so far...</h3>
					<p>Born in the midwest, I've had a love for programming since my first time making my name repeat across the screens of the computer in my school's library. Working with computers and writing programs has been a life long dream.</p>
					<p>Sadly coming from a blue collar family, and not being the most brilliant student, it was not possible for me to continue my studies after high school. I did complete an apprenticeship as an electronics technician at our local vocational school.</p>
					<p>After working for a few years as an electronics technician, I joined the United States Army, where I became a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corp, working in telecommunications. It was here that I learned much more about networks and computers.</p>
					<p>During my time as a soldier I started "playing around" writing code for MS Access databases using Visual Basic for Applications. I used this skill to assist our post's mailroom for tracking packages for the other soldiers.</p>
					<p>The time came for me to leave the Army, and I had decided I would like to stay in Germany with the wonderful woman who would eventually become my wife. I joined a small company that built communications systems for ships used in military roles. I started working there as a technical trainer. During my time as a technical trainer my desire to learn programming was still pretty hot. I began working on making websites, using HTML and early versions of CSS and JavaScript. I was also exploring desktop development with Visual Basic 6.</p>
					<p>Shortly after this I started working with PHP and found how nice it was to make a website truely dynamic. It was noticed by my management that I had a keen interest in software development, and so about seven years after starting with my company I was offered the chance to change professions. They sent me to learn Java and I would start working in the development department instead of doing just training. I jumped at this opportunity. I went home right away and started ordering books on Java development, and began learning that very night.</p>
					<p>I didn't just settle for writing code, but also worked hard to learn the tools of the trade for the whole development process. After a further seven years with this company I could take an idea, write an architecture and deliver a product. However, it was time for me to look else where for challenges. I was tired of working for military projects, I wanted something more commercial. I found that position with my current employer.</p>
					<p>I've been working for <a href="https://www.cartago.com">Cartago Software GmbH</a> since 2016, and in 2022 I assumed the role of vice-development lead.</p>
					<p>In a more personal context, the woman I stayed in Germany for became my wife, and together we are raising our three children. I learned to speak German somewhat fluently, and feel pretty well integrated in my neighborhood. I've even become a member of the Intergrationsbeirat for Landkreis Freising. I'm pretty proud how things have gone so far, and I'm looking forward to my an my family's future.</p>
